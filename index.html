      This should create two divs that look exactly the same, so that the div with the highlight can be placed behind the actual editable div, and display the highlights. -->

      <div>Palindromic words are those that read the same forward and backward, such as "wow", "solos", "tenet", or "rotator".</div>

      <div>Ma'am, did you refer to the 1,001 sagas of Bob and Anna, the civic planner and the racecar driver?</div>

      <div>Paddling a lil' kayak at noon (with no rotor), Bob became red, and then redder and redder.</div>

      <div><br></div>

      <div>Anna said, "Wow Dad, if your exposure level gets much higher, I might be required to become your reviver!"</div>
